- 👋 Hi, I’m Emily Marin >.<
- 👀 I’m interested in the way the world works, the way technology works on the back side when it comes to
binary numbers and logical gates. The way we can communicate on different platforms through a screen. :O
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the more CS part of my major, the classes I am taking this semester 
overlap with CS and EE. It's interesting how they all connect. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on class discussions and learning how to work with GitHub. 
- 📫 How to reach me...in person when you see me in class :)))) LOL
